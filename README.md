# week8

This week we are learning about the wonderful world of open source software and how to cheat life by stealing other peoples genius code!

Please create a "week8" repository in Github for this assignment. The HTML file should be called "index.html". I will open issues if these two items are not properly named. D: D: D:

The assignment has 3 parts:

1. API

Go to github.com/public-apis/public-apis and find an API that interest you
Try choosing an API that has Auth set to "No", but you aren't limited to that. If you find an API you like and want to sign up for their auth, go for it!
Post in the chatroom of Canvas for this class which API you selected. IT CAN NOT BE A DUPLICATE! First one to post is the one to use it.
In your code, make a fetch request to the API, get the JSON data from the request, and put the relevant information on the screen.
Use jsonlint.com to help format responses if you need to see them cleaned up a little bit
 

2. New Site w/ Bootstrap

getbootstrap.com
Check out their documentation and find the details for the following components:
grid (3 column view)
navbar (simple)
jumbotron
Implement those 3 components on your HTML page
 

3. Javascript library

Pick one of the following javascript libraries
Stickers.js: http://stickerjs.cmiscm.com/
Filterous https://github.com/girliemac/Filterous
Oridomi: https://oridomi.com/
Tiny Slider: https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider (Links to an external site.)
Read the documentation for the project
Install the project in your index.html page
Implement the library on the page in a demonstratable fashion.
